Problem Set 2:
We have the code along with the final plot output of a single run, with the line ax_1+bx_2+c=0, where (using variable finder) we see that the weights are,

a = -0.0065419563183276574  
b = -0.0071808969876720526  
c = 0.007811730018380093

Problem Set 3:
K Nearest Neighbour:
Letting K=2 and with the points (0.8, 0.2), (0.55,02), (0.2, 0.4) we get them classified as 0, 0, 1 respectively.

Decision Trees:
